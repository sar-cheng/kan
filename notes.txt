"Hey everyone, thanks for being here today! For those who don’t know me, I’m [Your Name], and I’ve had the amazing opportunity to be a data science intern here at JP Morgan over the past few months.

When I started this internship, I was excited but also a bit nervous. I was diving into the world of equity research—a field that's as challenging as it is fascinating. What I discovered was not just about analyzing numbers, but about leveraging the power of data science to automate processes and drive efficiency.

Today, I want to share with you some of the highlights of my journey. I’ll walk you through the different teams I worked with, the projects I tackled, and the insights I gained along the way. More importantly, I hope to enlighten you on how impactful data science can be in transforming the way we work and make decisions.

This experience has shown me the incredible potential of automated data processes and how they can revolutionize our workflow. And, as a student, being given this opportunity to learn and contribute at such a successful firm has been nothing short of transformative.

So, let’s kick things off with a quick overview of the equity research team. This will give you some context about where I’ve been spending my time and the fantastic people I’ve been collaborating with."
